Thank you for downloading Cindy Lou Who. 
Cindy Lou Who is set up for 3/4 in depth board and he is 30 inches high. She is also set up for two tool paths. The first is the 
outline that is drawn with the pen holder and sharpie marker, and the second is a 1/4 in router bit. I have included
the drawing in svg format as well as the svg that is loaded into maker cam. I also have the cut file if you use the 
parameters I mentioned before. Enjoy!
